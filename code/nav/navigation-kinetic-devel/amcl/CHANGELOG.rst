^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.14.4 (2018-06-19)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#731 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/731>`_ from maracuya-robotics/kinetic/amcl-dynamic-reconfigure
  AMCL dynamic reconfigure: Extend parameter range
* In Addition to `#696 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/696>`_, which checks the input arguments, this extends the
  allowed parameter range in dynamic reconfigure. The description for
  "save_pose_rate" says "-1.0 to disable" but allowed only positive values
  previously.
  Also increase maximum value for laser_max_beams for high performance
  systems.
* Merge pull request `#668 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/668>`_ from B0gdar/kinetic-devel
  Update laser_model_type enum on AMCL.cfg
  Adding likelihood_field_prob laser model option on AMCL.cfg to be able to control dynamic parameters with this laser sensor model.
* Contributors: Michael Ferguson, Miguel Cordero, maracuya-robotics

1.14.2 (2017-08-14)
-------------------

1.14.1 (2017-08-07)

* fix order of parameters (closes `#553 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/553>`_)
* Fix potential string overflow and resource leak
* Contributors: Dmitry Rozhkov, Laurent GEORGE, Martin GÃ¼nther, Michael Ferguson, Peter Harliman Liem, mryellow, vik748

1.14.0 (2016-05-20)
-------------------
* Allow AMCL to run from bag file to allow very fast testing.
* Fixes interpretation of a delayed initialpose message (see `#424 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/424>`_).
  The tf lookup as it was before this change was very likely to fail as
  ros::Time::now() was used to look up a tf without waiting on the tf's
  availability. Additionally, the computation of the "new pose" by
  multiplying the delta that the robot moved from the initialpose's
  timestamp to ros::Time::now() was wrong. That delta has to by multiplied
  from the right to the "old pose".
  This commit also changes the reference frame to look up this delta to be
  the odom frame as this one is supposed to be smooth and therefore the
  best reference to get relative robot motion in the robot (base link) frame.
* New unit test for proper interpretation of a delayed initialpose message.
  Modifies the set_pose.py script to be able to send an initial pose with
  a user defined time stamp at a user defined time. Adds a rostest to
  exercise this new option.
  This reveals the issues mentioned in `#424 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/424>`_ (the new test fails).
